# OdontRad - Measurement
OdontRad Measurement is a straightforward Python application designed for precise measurements in intraoral and panoramic X-rays. The application operates by measuring distances in pixels, providing a convenient means to gauge dimensions on radiographic images. Furthermore, it offers calibration functionalities, enabling users to correlate pixel measurements with real-world dimensions in millimeters.

Key Features:
- Pixel-based Measurement: Allows users to accurately measure distances within X-ray images directly in pixels.

- Calibration Capability: Offers a calibration feature to translate pixel measurements into millimeters, enhancing the clinical relevance of the measurements.

- User-friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring ease of use for dental professionals and researchers alike.

- Export and Review: Seamlessly export saved measurements to text files for integration with statistical or other analytical software. Previous measurements can be reviewed by importing saved files.
- Annotation Functionality: Allows users to annotate images and associate teeth IDs for automatic annotation of measurements. Annotations are automatically stored and loaded for enhanced workflow efficiency.
